# C++ Checkout Queue Manager

This project simulates multiple checkout counters in a store, each with its own **queue of customers**, implemented in C++. Users can interact with the system through a menu to manage customers in line.

## Features

- Create a custom number of checkout counters
- Each counter maintains its own queue of customers
- Add customers to a selected queue
- View the queue at any given counter
- Serve customers in **First-In, First-Out (FIFO)** order
- Switch between counters to manage different queues

## Core Concepts

- Queues and FIFO logic
- Managing multiple independent data structures
- Use of dynamic memory and basic pointer logic
- Command-line menu navigation
